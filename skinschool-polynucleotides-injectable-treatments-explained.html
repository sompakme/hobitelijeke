The appeal includes cosmetic benefits that are both short- and long-term. “I think this is a treatment that will take the world by storm,” he says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Intrigued (and a little irked by my hollowing under-eyes as I approached my 40s), I decided to try a targeted Ameela treatment with Dr Soni at his London residency within the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.langhamhotels.com/en/the-langham/london/wellness/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chuan Spa at The Langham" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Chuan Spa at The Langham</a>. As someone more interested in enhancing skin quality over editing my appearance, I have only ever tried – and loved – Profhilo in terms of aesthetic injectables. As positioned, I found the results of the polynucleotides (directed to the under-eyes) to look entirely natural.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition to my personal experience, below, Dr Soni, as well as Dr Johanna Ward – <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cosmeticskinclinic.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Cosmetic Skin Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Cosmetic Skin Clinic</a>'s award-winning cosmetic doctor, explain everything you need to know about injectable polynucleotides.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What are polynucleotides, and the benefits of these injectable treatments?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Polynucleotides are an injectable bio-stimulator,” Dr Soni explains. The stretchy molecules are made from fragments of fish which mirror human DNA.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The purpose of injecting the product is to stimulate our own cells to produce some of the things that we lose with ageing,” explains Dr Soni. Essentially, it “can change the expression of DNA,” Dr Ward tells me. “Polynucleotides <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a37526913/how-to-increase-collagen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="boost collagen" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">boost collagen</a> and elastin by up-regulating the fibroblast cells, as well as improving tissue regeneration and restoring skin tone and elasticity. It has an antioxidant and hydrating effect in addition to the bio-remodelling, therefore resulting in skin that looks and feels healthier,” Dr Soni continues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition to Ameela, there are various brands producing the injectable product for aesthetic purposes, including Nucleofill, Pluryal Silk, and Mastelli.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How do polynucleotides differ to injectable skin boosters, like Profhilo?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They are similar in terms of the effects,” Dr Soni says, but rather than just providing hydration like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a29759932/profhilo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hyaluronic acid skin boosters" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">hyaluronic acid skin boosters</a> [such as Profhilo, Teoxane Redensity 1, Belotero Revive, and Sunekos Performa], polynucleotides communicate with the cells to make them <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a37526913/how-to-increase-collagen/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="produce collagen" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">produce collagen</a> and elastin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also, “they work in all the areas many skin boosters can’t; like the eyes, lips, and forehead,” adds Dr Ward. This was one of the key factors that appealed to me, given that my Profhilo treatments couldn't reach my under-eye area and I wasn't keen on the idea of exploring dermal filler.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Where are polynucleotides typically injected?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They can be used effectively under the eyes, for the face and neck, and even for the jawline and cheekbones,” explains Dr Soni. Currently, most requested tends to be the eye area.</p><img alt="before and after injectable polynucleotides" title="Before and after injectable polynucleotides" width=2048 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/photo-2024-02-21-20-08-58-65dc5bb6cde9c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">The Soni Clinic</span><p>Before and immediately after injecting Ameela polynucleotides</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, polynucleotides for the under-eye area are changing the way cosmetic doctors work. “I have a huge cohort of patients who are bothered by their under-eye area but would not be candidates for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/a28828784/non-surgical-eye-bag-removal/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tear-trough filler" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">tear-trough filler</a>, given the presence of under-eye bags or lack of elasticity of the tissues,” says Dr Soni. “Now, I have polynucleotides, which have been shown to really improve this area in my patients of all ages.” And, for those already partaking in tear-trough filler for hollowing, “they can often space out the need for filler treatments a little more, with the addition of polynucleotides in a treatment plan”.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Who are suitable candidates for polynucleotide treatments?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s an animal product, so it’s not suitable for vegetarians, vegans or those with fish allergies. It’s also not appropriate for use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding – as with any injectable procedures. “I would not advocate someone too young getting the treatment either, unless there was something they were being specifically treated for,” adds Dr Soni. Otherwise, “the natural element of this treatment, and the fact that you can inject it into any type of anatomy, means that almost anyone is a candidate”. At his clinic – and, ideally, as standard wherever cosmetic procedures are performed – a thorough medical history is taken prior to the treatment being performed. “A provider must also screen for any psychological disorders or red flags before any aesthetic treatments,” Dr Soni adds.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What do polynucleotides treatments involve?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The treatment requires two-to-three sessions depending on the patient, spaced out by roughly two weeks, Dr Soni explains. “I apply local anaesthetic cream to the patient prior to injecting, and then administer the product to the desired area of the face or neck. For the under-eyes, I personally do not use any needles and use a blunt-tipped cannula through one point in the cheek, which minimises bruising and swelling to that area. Depending on your provider’s experience, the procedure itself is quick, and stings a little when you inject, but is tolerated well by patients.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, I found my treatment tolerable, although the sensation is a little odd. It took around five minutes per eye and after my treatment, Dr Soni used an ice pack on the under-eye and cheek areas to help minimise subsequent mild swelling (which I only noticed for a few hours post-treatment) and bruising (which I didn't experience at all).</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">When do you see the results of polynucleotides, and how long do they last?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You start to see the results quite quickly after the first session,” says Dr Soni, “but the second session will really kickstart that remodelling process. The product continues to work for the first 12 weeks, so it continues to improve with time – however, you do get an improvement and lift early on after the first session.” Six weeks on from my first appointment with Dr Soni I have noticed a subtle reduction in the hollowing of my under-eyes and fewer fine lines.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To enhance under-eye results, post-procedure Dr Soni recommends using the Alastin Restorative Eye Complex (available in-clinics). The innovative formula "recycles old fragments of collagen and elastin," he tells me, "optimising the function of fibroblasts [which produce collagen] and up-regulating anti-ageing genes in the skin".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On average, results of polynucleotide treatments last around six months before a patient would require one maintenance session.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: Trialling a Sarah Chapman facial" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2020-01-16-at-12-27-22-1579177668.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Can you combine polynucleotides with other cosmetic treatments?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the Cosmetic Skin Clinic, Dr Ward performs polynucleotide treatments alone as well as in combination with other tech treatments. “The brilliant thing about polynucleotides is that they can be combined with any type of energy treatment,” she says, which is why she favours a double eye treatment using Thermage Eyes (a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/news/a42867/radiofrequency-facials/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=radiofrequency class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">radiofrequency</a> skin tightening procedure) with Ameela (the polynucleotides injectable treatment). “This is particularly good for dark circles, soft hollowing under the eye and addressing the crepey tissue around the eye,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Polynucleotides are commonly used in tandem with dermal filler treatments, too, “however, always this needs to be approached on a case-to-case basis,” confirms Dr Soni. He prefers to stagger these treatments, he explains. “For example, if someone has an extremely hollow under-eye area, my preference would be to inject tear-trough filler first, let it settle, and then come in with the polynucleotides to really improve that skin quality. However, there is no set algorithm for this, and you would need to make that assessment after examining a patient at the time of the consultation, and also making sure that the patient’s goals and expectations are realistic and can be met safely and effectively.”</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What are the risks associated with injectable polynucleotides?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As with any injectable treatment, there are risks to be aware of. “There are many providers on their social media who are saying there are no risks associated with polynucleotides, but that is not true,” confirms Dr Soni. “The risks can be much less than those carried by other injectable procedures, however it all depends on the provider, their experience, and their technique.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another thing to note is that if you did have any issues with polynucleotides, the treatment cannot be reversed like dermal filler can as “the product cannot be dissolved,” explains Dr Soni. “But again, the risk is much lower as the product is not a gel.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The most common risks with injectable treatments such as polynucleotide treatments include bruising and swelling, “but in my practice I can tell you that I have hardly seen much of either,” he adds. I had no bruising and my swelling was very mild, and likely not noticeable to others seeing me.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How can you choose a trusted practitioner for injectable polynucleotides?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Firstly, I would research your chosen practitioner very carefully, and ensure you know their training, experience, and how long they have been doing this for. This isn’t something that just any provider or practitioner should be injecting,” says Dr Soni. As with all cosmetic procedures, safety is paramount. “Search the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gmc-uk.org/registration-and-licensing/the-medical-register data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="General Medical Council Register" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">General Medical Council Register</a> if they are a doctor, and make sure that they have a full licence to practice in the UK. The same applies for other types of practitioners and checking their respective governing bodies.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You should also see a practitioner’s ‘before-and-afters’, to ensure their results are to your liking. “In addition, make sure that at the time of the consultation, you feel as though you can trust that provider, because this is your face,” cautions Dr Soni. “Please do not simply go based on cost, or social media following, because this does not correlate with experience. High quality practitioners using the best quality products will cost, but it is worth it.”</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How much do polynucleotides treatments cost?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prices can vary from between £350 to £700 per session, depending on how big an area you’re having treated, and the clinic you’re visiting.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6i4qrrCmqmeZ5FpgXiDkG5qamegpLm6utSco56npJ6xpr%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fskinschool-polynucleotides-injectable-treatments-explained.html&text=%23SkinSchool%3a%20Polynucleotides%20injectable%20treatments%20explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fskinschool-polynucleotides-injectable-treatments-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fskinschool-polynucleotides-injectable-treatments-explained.html&title=%23SkinSchool%3a%20Polynucleotides%20injectable%20treatments%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fskinschool-polynucleotides-injectable-treatments-explained.html&title=%23SkinSchool%3a%20Polynucleotides%20injectable%20treatments%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fskinschool-polynucleotides-injectable-treatments-explained.html&title=%23SkinSchool%3a%20Polynucleotides%20injectable%20treatments%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fskinschool-polynucleotides-injectable-treatments-explained.html&description=%23SkinSchool%3a%20Polynucleotides%20injectable%20treatments%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./11-self-care-essentials-courteney-cox-swears-by.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 Self-Care Essentials Courteney Cox Swears By">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-reason-so-many-six-toed-cats-live-at-the-hemingway-house.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Reason So Many Six-Toed Cats Live At The Hemingway House">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
