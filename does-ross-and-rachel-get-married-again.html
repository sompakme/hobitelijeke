After years of separation, the two finally get back together for good, saying "this is it", hinting they will marry after the series (which is revealed to be true in the spin-off, Joey).<h2>Do Rachel and Ross end up together?</h2>Ross and Rachel end up together at last. Monica and Chandler become parents (and even get one more child than they asked for). Phoebe has already gotten married to her soulmate. Even Joey gets his own modest version of happily ever after.<h2>Do Ross and Rachel get married on Joey?</h2>In the Joey pilot episode, Joey Tribbiani mentioned that all of his friends are married. Chandler and Monica were already married by the Friends series finale, as was the case with Phoebe and Mike. His comments insinuated that Ross and Rachel got remarried sometime after the final episode.<h2>How many times does Ross get married?</h2>Ross Geller, also known as Ross the Divorcer or Ross the Divorce Force was married three times in total. Here's everything you need to know about Ross's failed marriages.<h2>Friends Just Married Ross & Rachel</h2><p></p><h2>Do Ross and Rachel get divorced?</h2>In the season 5 finale "The One in Vegas", Ross and Rachel marry each other after getting drunk in Las Vegas. This marriage ends in a divorce after a failed application for an annulment; the two sadly admit that they thought if they ever married each other it would last.<h2>Who does Joey marry in Friends?</h2>In the end, Joey was the only one from the main group in Friends that didn't get married, but he did end up in a committed relationship with Alex.<h2>Do Ross and Rachel get back together after Emma is born?</h2>Ross and Rachel move in together during her pregnancy so Ross could be more involved with the baby and be there for Rachel. After Emma's birth, they all live together until the season 9 episode "The One Where Monica Sings".<h2>Do Rachel and Ross have babies?</h2>In season seven, Ross and Rachel have sex, and Rachel gets pregnant. Rachel gives birth to a girl in season eight, naming the baby Emma Geller-Green; the name Emma is a gift from Monica, who had previously been reserving the name for her own child.<h2>Who does Ross end up with?</h2>Ross and Rachel end up together at last (after having a child, Emma, together). In the tenth and final season of Friends, Rachel gets offered a job at Louis Vuitton in Paris. On the series finale, Phoebe and Ross go to the airport to try to convince Rachel to stay, but she still gets on the plane.<h2>Do Joey and Rachel ever sleep together?</h2>“Kauffman and Crane understood that the Joey-Rachel relationship would end before it really began,” Miller writes. “They would never have sex or say the L-word; that would be too much to recover from. Once they actually hooked up, the characters (like the audience) would be too weirded out, and preoccupied with Ross.”<h2>Do Phoebe and Joey end up together?</h2>Phoebe ends up with someone else<p>Joey later tries to get with Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) in season 10. But she doesn't feel the same way about him and she ends up with Ross (David Schwimmer). The show ends with Joey staying single and Phoebe gets married to Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd).</p><h2>Does Friends have a happy ending?</h2>After years of an on-and-off relationship and having a baby together, Ross and Rachel finally get their happy ending.<h2>Why Joey didn't get a happy ending?</h2>Originally Answered: Why was there no proper ending for Joey in F.R.I.E.N.D.S? Because creators had decided to make a spin-off,an entire show about his character. So how can they get his story going if they give him a proper ending in FRIENDS.<h2>Is Monica pregnant in season 10?</h2>Toward the end of filming season 10, Cox was pregnant with her first child, her daughter Coco, who was born just a few weeks after the final episode of "Friends" aired on NBC. Since Monica was not expecting on the show, Cox's pregnancy was strategically hidden with baggy shirts and props.<h2>Who ends with WHO in Friends?</h2>Joey and Phoebe<p>These two did not pair off together (or with any of the other titular friends) but they did both get their happily ever after, so to speak, a little earlier. In the final season, Phoebe got engaged and married to Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd, looking the same as he does now).</p><h2>Do Monica and Chandler adopt twins?</h2>Jack Bing, Erica Bing<p>Lastly we have the Bing twins, Jack and Erica, who made their debut in the series finale. Monica and Chandler adopted the twins from their biological mother (Anna Faris), although—in true sitcom fashion—they didn't know they were having twins until they were in the delivery room!</p><h2>Does Chandler and Monica have a baby?</h2>Jack and Erica were born in the series finale. Monica and Chandler were unaware at the time of their birth that they would be receiving twins and Monica had to calm Chandler down at first. Erica was second to be born and therefore the unexpected baby.<h2>What happened to Ross's son Ben?</h2>"He moved to England. So we've come after him and that's why we're gonna stay," Sibbett explained, with Hecht adding: "We put him in a boarding school just to get him out of dodge. We put him in a British boarding school. We eventually come here (the UK), adopt children and home school them in London."<h2>What happened to Rachel and Ross's baby?</h2>Theoretically, with Ross and Rachel back together, Emma has gone from an amiable if uneven co-parenting situation to having both of her biological parents in one household. But the last time Ross and Rachel tried to raise her in the same apartment, Rachel and Emma ended up moving in with Joey (Matt LeBlanc).<h2>Who is the father of Rachel's baby in season 8?</h2>Meanwhile, Phoebe and Joey fib about a gas leak to gain entry to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Everyone seems to know who the father of Rachel's unborn baby is except for the man himself: Ross.<h2>Do Phoebe and Mike get married?</h2>Phoebe's Ending in Friends Was Originally Supposed to Be Very Different. Really happy this isn't how things worked out. Phoebe may have had a rough start to life, but by the end of Friends, she was in a great place, married to the love of her life: Mike Hannigan.<h2>Who got married on Friends in real life?</h2>Unlike some of her Friends co-stars, Lisa Kudrow has been in a committed relationship since the '90s. She married businessman Michel Stern in 1995 and the two share a son together named Julian Murray Stern, who is an actor.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxloqTAtHnAp5tmqpGYtaa4jKCcrWWdlr%2BztcSdZJqfkZ67</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-ross-and-rachel-get-married-again.html&text=Does%20Ross%20and%20Rachel%20get%20married%20again%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-ross-and-rachel-get-married-again.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-ross-and-rachel-get-married-again.html&title=Does%20Ross%20and%20Rachel%20get%20married%20again%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-ross-and-rachel-get-married-again.html&title=Does%20Ross%20and%20Rachel%20get%20married%20again%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-ross-and-rachel-get-married-again.html&title=Does%20Ross%20and%20Rachel%20get%20married%20again%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-ross-and-rachel-get-married-again.html&description=Does%20Ross%20and%20Rachel%20get%20married%20again%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jeremy-renner-s-mayor-of-kingstown-renewed-for-season-3-on-paramount.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeremy Renner's Mayor of Kingstown Renewed for Season 3 on Paramount+">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./courtney-stodden-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Courtney Stodden Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
