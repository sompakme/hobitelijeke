I lost my best friend, and I think that really does change you and makes you look at things differently.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Richards shared that when her best friend, Lorene Shea, died by suicide in 2022, which she she has discussed during the currently airing 13th season of the Bravo series, it played a role in reevaluating aspects of her life, including figuring out what she was willing to “accept and not accept” in her marriage. She added, “It’s not like there was one big thing [that caused the split]. We do love each other very much and have a lot of respect for each other, so that makes it even harder to make a decision like that.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The reality couple share four daughters, Farrah Brittany Aldjufrie, Alexia Simone Umansky, Sophia Kylie Umansky and Portia Umansky. Richards said that when they began filming this season of RHOBH, they hadn’t yet shared the news with their daughters. “I have a job to share my life, and to be honest. And I always have been. And he wasn’t really ready to share that, so that was very challenging for me to balance that,” she said. “And then I thought, ‘This is pretty apparent, so I’m just going to have to just put this out there that things are not great right now.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She noted that, currently, she and Umansky still “live under the same roof in different rooms,” but split their time in their various other properties.&nbsp;She said they are friendly when they are together as a family, and that she doesn’t know what the future holds, including if she’ll return to the series.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She said she felt a lack of support from the cast, noting castmate Erika Jayne as being the most supportive. And she said her sisters, Kim Richards and Kathy Hilton, have been supportive, despite a recent estrangement from the latter.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“My dream was to be married forever and grow old with this person.

In the preview for what’s next in Umansky’s real estate series, the Agency co-founder is shown speaking with his daughters, explaining the reason behind the marriage not working out.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I had an amazing 26 years with your mom, an amazing 26 years. I wanted to do everything possible to just save it,” he says to his visibly emotional daughters. “So, you know, your mom came and she talked to me and she said, ‘I think I need space.’ She said to me, ‘Listen, the rules are that, you know, you go out, you date, you do whatever it is that you want to do. I’m not going to be asking you what you’re doing. I don’t want you to be asking me what I’m doing.
