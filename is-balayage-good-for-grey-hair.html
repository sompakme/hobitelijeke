If you do use heat tools, put them on the lowest setting and use a good thermal protectant. If your gray hair yellows, you can try purple shampoo or a purple mask.<h2>How can I make my GREY hair look better?</h2>"Gray or white hair tends to look best with pink, olive, and dark complexions," says Lisa Chiccine, a stylist and owner of the Lisa Chiccine Salon in New York City.

Instead of bleach streaks or all-over highlights, balayage uses a sweeping motion to add color to the midshaft and ends of your hair.<h2>Is a balayage worth it?</h2>Balayage highlights are great for just about everyone looking for dimension, a seamless melt, tasteful highlights, and an on-trend color design – an application that offers a truly modern ombre. Although many people refer to it as a style, balyage is not the result, but the technique.<h2>How do you turn grey hair into highlights?</h2>All you need to do is apply a demi-permanent color all over your head.

Your natural brown hair will just pick up some extra shine!<h2>Should I highlight or lowlight my gray hair?</h2>It's a truth universally acknowledged that gray hair can be chic, glamorous, and oh-so-flattering.
