replied:</span></p><p><span>“I am convinced that there is a distinction between revealing my sexual preferences and my most private thoughts.&nbsp;My sexual preference is an irrefutable aspect of me, like the</span><span>&nbsp;color&nbsp;</span><span>of my skin.&nbsp;I have never been interested in revealing intimate details about my life.&nbsp;The concern of the media is to try to ensure that they will understand this difference.&nbsp;»</span></p><p><strong><span>See Also: Anjelah Johnson Husband, Marriage, Parents, Net Worth</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>Luke

now.&nbsp;they’ve been very quiet about their relationship, obviously, because Wentworth hasn’t come out of the closet.&nbsp;“</span></p><p><span>Wentworth eventually came out as gay, but just as
