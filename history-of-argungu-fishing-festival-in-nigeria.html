Argungu fishing festival is one of the oldest traditional festivals in Nigeria The first known Argungu festival took place back in the 16th century. First, it started out as a form of religious rituals. It was considered to be an informal event for families and communities. However, it has gone through lots of modifications and changes since then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4mamkm13pko.jpg><p class=align-left>During that time, a couple of important rituals were widely performed in the country. First two were related to water and fishing and were called Gyaran Ruwa and Fashin Ruwa. The other two were more connected with land, and their names were Gyaran Gari and Shan Kabewa and Fura.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c59150e7b4613d08.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Opinion: When Lagos state politician turns his attention on the less privileged, orphans</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These festivals gained a lot of popularity among people and had a large number of attractions and entertainers. However, when the area started adopting Islamic culture, three of these festivals were canceled. Fashin Ruwa was the only one that remained, and many people believe it gave a start to Argungu festival.</p><p class=align-left>Fashin Ruwa was a special festive event that signified the opening of waters for fishing and it had a large relevance among local people. It also became a popular fun event, with musicians, dancers, acrobats, boxers, wrestlers, and other kinds of artistes. Large crowds of people attended the festival and watched the magnificent performances. Soon, it transformed into Argungu international fishing and cultural festival. At first, this festival was supposed to be non-religious, but eventually, it gained some traditional religious notes.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Festivals in Nigeria and where they are celebrated</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c59150e7b4613d08.jpg><h2>Modern development of Argungu fishing festival</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt43j5ocli3ci.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover the amazing culture of Benue State people</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The festival officially resumed in 1934. The historic significance of it is celebrating the end of long hostility between Kebbi kingdom and Sokoto caliphate region. The 1934 festival was known for its large attendance and the presence of officials, an example being Sultan of Sokoto, who was invited by the Emir of Argungu. The Emir council also arranged a huge fishing exhibition, which symbolized the identity of Kabawa. The boxing and wrestling events were canceled since the government felt they were not as entertaining anymore. Thus, the festival was now devoted entirely to fishing.</p><p class=align-left>Since 1934, the government paid special attention to the fishing event in Argungu, trying to make it as festive and memorable as possible. Some large investments were put into the development of the annual fishing celebration. The event takes place every year for four days, and the grand finale usually takes place on Saturday or Sunday.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7d4738pvh34.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>This is how the amazing Koroso dance was created</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt69c1p6p5k67.jpg><p class=align-left>The most active participation of the government in the festival development started in the late 1960s when the Northern Regional Government was established. They invested a lot of money in the restructuring of the event to make it as interesting and exciting as possible for Nigerians and the tourists. There was a strict aim to make Argungu fishing festival a cultural pride of Nigeria, and the organizers succeeded in it.</p><p class=align-left>In 1970, the attendance of the festival reached 100,000 people. More and more government officials started visiting the event, including ambassadors from other countries, and it started attracting more and more regular Nigerians. Even the other Nigerian states have established their own camps in the fishing village. As of today, the Argungu festival is visited by travelers from Europe, the United States, South East Asia, and other African countries like Cameroon, Benin Republic, Niger etc.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt43j5ocli3ci.jpg><p class=align-left>The Argungu festival started attracting various international guests, including music performers and entertainers, in the late 1970s. Nowadays, it has a lot of various activities, which include a grand fishing competition, a diverse agriculture show, craft exhibitions, cultural entertainment, and music compositions.
