White women, especially those older than 35, have the highest rate of higher-order multiple births (triplets or more).<h2>Which triplet is most likely to… - Sturniolo Triplets</h2><p></p><h2>What month are most twins conceived?</h2>It's estimated that half of all twins are born early, prior to 36 weeks gestation, which is almost a month before the standard 40 weeks gestation of a singleton baby. Triplets and other higher-order multiples have an even greater chance of being born early.<h2>Why does Africa have the most twins?</h2>Professor Monden explained that, “The twinning rate in Africa is so high because of the high number of dizygotic twins – twins born from two separate eggs – born there." He continued, “This is most likely to be due to genetic differences between the African population and other populations.”<h2>Which parent carries twin gene?</h2>The gene versions that increase the chance of hyperovulation can be passed down from parent to child. This is why fraternal twins run in families. However, only women ovulate. So, the mother's genes control this and the fathers don't.<h2>Do twins have a lower IQ?</h2>On average, twins have lower IQ scores at 7 and 9 years old than singleton children in the same family. In a cohort study, Ronalds and colleagues (p 1306) used data on 9832 singletons and 236 twins born in Aberdeen between 1950 and 1956.<h2>Can triplets be different genders?</h2>Trizygotic or fraternal triplets are formed when three separate eggs are fertilised by three separate sperm. The babies can be the same or opposite genders. This means that it's possible to have anyone of the following combinations of babies – three girls/three boys or, one girl and two boys or two girls and one boy.<h2>Is having triplets genetic?</h2>Contrary to popular belief, identical twins (or triplets or quadruplets) don't actually run in families. Fraternal multiples might, if the women in a particular family share some genetic trait that makes them more likely to release two or more eggs during an ovulation cycle instead of one.<h2>Can you make yourself have triplets?</h2>Medications like clomiphene citrate and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) help your body produce eggs. These are often used for low fertility but can lead to a triplet pregnancy if multiple eggs are released and fertilized.<h2>Who are the oldest living triplets?</h2>Betty Hocky Woolf, of Carlsbad, (left) her brother, Joseph Hocky, and sister, Minna Hocky Passman, at age 93, are recognized as the oldest living 'mixed' triplets in the 2020 Guinness World Records.<h2>How can I increase my chances of having triplets?</h2>The most likely way to conceive with triplets is to have fertility assistance and/or take medication which increases ovulation. There does not seem to be any scientific evidence to support the theory that having identical multiples is influenced by heredity.<h2>Can I have twins if it doesn't run in the family?</h2>Everyone has the same chance of having identical twins: about 1 in 250. Identical twins do not run in families. But there are some factors that make having non-identical twins more likely: non-identical twins are more common in some ethnic groups, with the highest rate among Nigerians and the lowest among Japanese.<h2>Why do twins skip a generation?</h2>This belief is based on the assumption that twinning is genetic and runs in families. However, if that was truly the case—if there was a twin gene—then twins would occur with predictable frequency in those families that carry the gene. There is no concrete scientific evidence that suggests twins skip a generation.<h2>Who is most likely to have twins?</h2>Age. According to the Office on Women's Health , women who are aged 30 years or older are more likely to conceive twins. The reason for this is that women of this age are more likely than younger women to release more than one egg during their reproductive cycle.<h2>Are Mexican twins uncommon?</h2>Twin births have historically been more common among non-Hispanic black women, but rates among white women have risen faster. In 2009, twin birth rates were similar in the two groups: 38 per 1,000 births for black women and 37 for white women. Hispanic women had twins at a rate of 22.5 per 1,000 births.<h2>Who has the most kids in the world?</h2>The first wife of peasant Yakov Kirillov from the village of Vvedensky, Russia, gave birth to 57 children in a total of 21 births. She had four sets of quadruplets, seven sets of triplets and ten sets of twins.<h2>Which city has most twins in the world?</h2>Cândido Godói is a village of 7,000 inhabitants in the south of Brazil that has a phenomenal number of twin births. The rate is ten times higher than the national average, and no one knows why.<h2>What is the most common gender for twins?</h2>The Science of Fraternal Twins. Mixed-gender twins are the most common type of fraternals, some 50 percent are boy-girl. To understand this combination: Males have XY chromosomes, females have XX chromosomes. You have a girl twin when the father's X chromosome combines with the mother's X chromosome.<h2>What name is given to a father of twins?</h2>And if you're willing to accept two words, I vote for "double daddy"! "Twin fatherhood" (suggested in your question) is pretty good, I think. If these are his first children, you could also say "new dad times two" – but that's hardly an established phrase.<h2>Does giving birth to twins hurt more?</h2>Women pregnant with twins complain of more back pain, sleeping difficulties, and heartburn than those who are carrying one child. Being pregnant with twins also carries a higher rate of maternal anemia and a higher rate of postpartum hemorrhage (bleeding) after delivery.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lopawpnnIrGSmp6Opeq21yp6jsmWkpHqprdWeZK2qmaW5psDS</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-race-is-most-likely-to-have-triplets.html&text=What%20race%20is%20most%20likely%20to%20have%20triplets%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-race-is-most-likely-to-have-triplets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-race-is-most-likely-to-have-triplets.html&title=What%20race%20is%20most%20likely%20to%20have%20triplets%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-race-is-most-likely-to-have-triplets.html&title=What%20race%20is%20most%20likely%20to%20have%20triplets%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-race-is-most-likely-to-have-triplets.html&title=What%20race%20is%20most%20likely%20to%20have%20triplets%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-race-is-most-likely-to-have-triplets.html&description=What%20race%20is%20most%20likely%20to%20have%20triplets%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-i-fell-out-of-love-with-new-york-guest-column.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why I Fell Out of Love With New York (Guest Column)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-tv-show-edge-of-alaska.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What happened to TV show edge of Alaska?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
