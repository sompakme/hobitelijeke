He claims that John Cena only returned because Roman took his leave and that Cena had the audacity to let people call him the greatest of all time.

Remarkably, Elton has made an incredible recovery and is now known as “Elton Strong.”</p><p>Elton makes his entrance, and the crowd erupts with excitement as he stands up from a wheelchair, signaling that he’s back in action and ready to compete.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The action in the ring intensifies as Butch and Elton begin the match.

They share a fist bump, indicating that they’re on the same page now.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bayley-with-dakota-kai-and-iyo-sky-vs-zelina-vega>Bayley (with Dakota Kai and Iyo Sky) vs. Zelina Vega</h2><p>In a match that quickly picked up the pace, Bayley initially proposes a test of strength, but Zelina Vega responds with a forearm strike.

In response, Vega kicks Iyo off the apron, but this allows Bayley to capitalize with a knee strike to Vega’s face, followed by her Rose Plant finisher for the three-count.</p><p><strong>Winner: Bayley</strong></p><p>After the match, both Iyo and Bayley continue the attack on Vega. Charlotte Flair makes her way to the ring, albeit cautiously in her heels, as The Bayley Bunch retreats from the scene.</p><p>Triple H, also known as Hunter Hearst Helmsley, makes his way to the ring, joining Adam Pearce, who is already present in the corner.</p><p>Hunter addresses the crowd, acknowledging that a significant part of him misses the electric chants from the WWE Universe. He reflects on the excitement in the arena, mentioning that it might be the time of year, but they’ve just had a successful Fastlane event, and they are heading towards Crown Jewel and Survivor Series. Hunter emphasizes that it all begins right here tonight on the season premiere of Smackdown.</p><p>Triple H takes the opportunity to shine a spotlight on an unsung hero of WWE, Adam Pearce. He acknowledges Adam’s great career as an in-ring performer but emphasizes his exceptional work as a WWE official over the last three years. Pearce has handled the challenging task of managing the superstars of both Raw and Smackdown, overseeing both shows. Hunter extends his gratitude to Adam for the outstanding job he has done.</p><p>Hunter then reveals that no one should shoulder this responsibility alone and, as of this moment, Adam Pearce is being promoted to the position of General Manager of Raw. This announcement leads to the unveiling of the General Manager of Smackdown.</p><p>Dominik Mysterio interrupts, expressing his concerns about the recent events, such as THE Judgment Day getting screwed out of their tag titles at Fastlane and Jey and Cody defending their titles tonight when THE Judgment Day has a title match scheduled. He questions Hunter’s decisions.</p><p>Hunter pretends he can’t hear Dom due to the loud crowd and suggests Dom talks to the Smackdown General Manager, Nick Aldis, about his grievances.</p><p>Nick Aldis enters the ring, shakes Hunter’s hand, and expresses his gratitude for the opportunity to be in charge of the number one brand in sports entertainment. He hints at potential competition between the brands and introduces the newest member of the Smackdown roster.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Dominik dismissively states that nobody cares and mentions that Cody and Jey are the problem he has to deal with. He threatens to smack the newest Smackdown superstar.</p><p>However, Kevin Owens makes his way to the ring. He looks around at everyone and, in a surprising twist, kicks Dominik and delivers a stunner, seemingly because Dom is not wearing a suit.</p><p>Nick and Kevin shake hands, and the others in the ring also exchange handshakes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Meanwhile, in Roman Reigns’ suite, he becomes increasingly unhappy. He realizes that Kevin Owens is on his show, along with Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso. Jimmy Uso is on his couch, and Roman questions why everyone is on his show, emphasizing that he called the shots. He instructs Jimmy to “run the play,” and Jimmy leaves the suite with Solo.</p><p>The show heads to a commercial break.</p><p><br>As we return from the commercial break, there is a spotlight on Dragon Lee, who expresses his desire to show the world that he is a special talent in professional wrestling.</p><p>Chelsea Green and Piper Niven are seen with Nick Aldis, expressing their concerns about the supposed curse of the tag titles. Chelsea even suggests the idea of introducing new title belts to break the curse.</p><p>Nick mentions that he has a meeting with Charlotte Flair and asks Chelsea and Piper to leave. Before they go, Nick points out that he watched the match at Fastlane and believes that if the referee hadn’t been distracted, Chelsea might have become the champion. He announces that next week, Charlotte will face Iyo Del Amor for the Women’s Championship.</p><p>Just as Nick finishes speaking, Charlotte Flair turns around and comes face to face with Jade Cargill. Hunter attempts to introduce Jade to Charlotte, but Charlotte interjects, stating that she already knows who Jade is. Jade offers a polite greeting, and Charlotte walks away.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The tension between the two talented female wrestlers is palpable as they cross paths on Smackdown.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jey-uso-and-cody-rhodes-vs-austin-theory-and-grayson-waller-for-the-men-s-tag-titles><strong>Jey Uso and Cody Rhodes vs. Austin Theory and Grayson Waller for the Men’s Tag Titles</strong></h2><p>The match is underway with Cody Rhodes and Grayson Waller starting things off.
