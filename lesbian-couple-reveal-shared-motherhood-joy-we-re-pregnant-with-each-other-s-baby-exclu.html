I come from a family of mostly girls. We both predicted one of each gender or two girls, so two boys were the last thing we expected.</p><p id=enp3vC9rD6a data-wc=30>“We were shocked, overwhelmed & ecstatic all at the same time, but we could not be any more excited for life and adventures with our not one, but two boys!”</p><p id=eXmn88d9iFR data-wc=8></p><h2><strong>Congratulations on your pregnancies Kerry and Emily! Tell us how you first met…</strong></h2><p id=eRnGSYweELqJ data-wc=54><strong>Kerry:</strong> We met six years ago on Tinder when I was 29 and Emily was 32. I was travelling in New Zealand and Emily was living there at the time. We kept talking and FaceTiming when I got back, then Emily moved home, and we met up in London – the rest is history.</p><p id=e0hVtagO0lgp data-wc=12><strong>Emily:</strong> We moved in together about a year and a half later.</p><p id=eN-h3Pt-T9KG data-wc=55>During lockdown, we started thinking about having children. One of Kerry’s friends had done IVF and we had time to research it all. We found a company called ABC IVF which had good rates and I was still just within the age range of qualifying for the treatment, so we decided to go for it.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Exclusive: Ola and James Jordan's emotional IVF journey with daughter Ella and hopes for second baby" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fe23fe1f0734-ola-and-james-jordan-hero-photo-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Exclusive: Ola and James Jordan's emotional IVF journey with daughter Ella and hopes for second baby" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>Exclusive: Ola and James Jordan's emotional IVF journey with daughter Ella and hopes for second baby</a></h5></li></ul><h2><strong>How did it come about that you decided to be pregnant at the same time?</strong></h2><p id=ehRCTbW8u0Gl data-wc=33><strong>Emily:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We thought, ‘Why don’t we just do it at the same time?’ We didn’t want to go through having a newborn and the sleepless nights then have to do it all again.</p><p id=eG-78pJ_oH7b data-wc=40>It didn’t particularly go down well with anyone we suggested it to, even the IVF people. They said, ‘What if you both have twins? What if you go into labour at the same time?’ We said we’d deal with it.</p><p id=eUASJoeKw80o data-wc=45>Our situation is very rare, but I’ve heard of a couple of Australian ladies who got pregnant at the same time, although they carried their own babies. I haven’t heard of any of the women being pregnant at the same time and carrying each other’s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/85b236a300ff-baby-scans.jpg><h2><strong>Tell us why you decided to carry each other’s babies…</strong></h2><p id=emi4C4Cdbe3O data-wc=67><strong>Kerry:&nbsp;</strong>For both of us, there’s no biological connection to the other person’s child because we have a [sperm] donor<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>so we felt if we could be the gestational parent to each other’s baby then we’ve got that connection with them – it’s not blood but it’s a different kind of connection. That was why we wanted to do it, to feel that connection in that way.</p><p id=eC48EL6lRap9 data-wc=30><strong>Emily:</strong> I thought that I would be really aware I’m carrying a baby that’s not mine, but I’m not, and that’s a really nice thing. It feels like our baby.</p><h2><strong>You went through a sperm donor agency – what was the process like?</strong></h2><p id=eG64WgtA6Jh7 data-wc=48><strong>Emily:</strong> It was so stressful! If you think about building a baby in your head… you want it to look like you and you want it to have certain features, so it resembles you or the other person. We’re quite lucky because myself and Kerry look fairly similar.</p><p id=ety1BqS8c3g4 data-wc=53><strong>Kerry:</strong> We spoke to some friends who are a same sex couple who’ve had IVF and we asked them what we should look for. They said to us, ‘Focus on health.’ We were like, ‘Yep, of course, that’s a really sensible thing to focus on’, so we picked someone who was really healthy.</p><p id=eFpg9ap_vaVy data-wc=37><strong>Emily:</strong> We both used the same sperm donor. For us that was really important, so our children are related. The process was a lot longer than we thought it would be and it’s been a learning experience.</p><p id=ek7hWuJUcez0 data-wc=22><strong>Kerry:</strong> I’m quite geeky so I found all the science behind it really interesting. It’s cliché but it genuinely is a rollercoaster.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9fb7ff5e88cb-gender-reveal.jpg><h2><strong>Did you both have IVF at the same time?</strong></h2><p id=eB0UnnpecaZK data-wc=44><strong>Kerry:&nbsp;</strong>You have to have tests to get the all-clear on your womb, which I had. Emily had polyps and a cyst which she had to have treated first. That’s the first stage, then you have your egg collection followed by the fertilisation stage.</p><p id=eRxp74I2CpTs data-wc=53><strong>Emily:&nbsp;</strong>We had our egg collection done within a month of each other. I had my first transfer two weeks after Kerry’s, but Kerry’s first try didn’t work. I got pregnant the first time and Kerry got pregnant after the second attempt, which was six weeks after I found out I was expecting.</p><h2><strong>What was it like when you found out Emily was pregnant?</strong></h2><p id=e4-8JVLxSXlp data-wc=45><strong>Kerry:&nbsp;</strong>On the actual day I think it hit me a bit harder because I was healthy and had a clear womb, so I think deep in the back of my mind I wondered why it didn’t work. I was trying to be realistic though.</p><p id=eZUE-uzvLt49 data-wc=8><strong>Emily:&nbsp;</strong>She started blaming it on my embryos!</p><p id=e8FEYYDLItBJ data-wc=27><strong>Kerry:&nbsp;</strong>We were OK but that first day we were a bit like, ‘Oh’. We didn’t expect it not to work; we were just hoping it would.</p><p id=evFeqnMstQMR data-wc=18><strong>Emily:</strong> I had been so sure I wasn’t expecting because Kerry wasn’t pregnant, so it was a surprise.</p><p id=eyJsGDGLCZu3 data-wc=39><strong>Kerry:&nbsp;</strong>We’re on Instagram and the IVF community on there is incredible. You see so many people having numerous transfers and it never working, so we had to put things into perspective – it was only our first try.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/baa2a34d78d3-expecting-boys.jpg><h2><strong>Then Kerry fell pregnant too… how did you both feel?</strong></h2><p id=elmbA0AvmDBQ data-wc=36><strong>Emily:</strong> We cried both times, didn’t we? I think through the whole process we were so nervous, so even when we had two positive results, we didn’t let ourselves get too excited and were quite cautious.</p><p id=etDK61igPrGG data-wc=19>Our parents were already going out buying prams and cots! We were like, ‘Chill out, we’ll see what happens.’</p><h2><strong>How have your family and friends reacted to your news?</strong></h2><p id=e_poYfDwiBmj data-wc=36><strong>Kerry:&nbsp;</strong>When we first told everyone that we were thinking about having babies at the same time, they were like, ‘Ooh not sure… who’s going to pick up the dog poo? Who’s going to wash up?'</p><p id=e2_n6crT9I8F data-wc=22>Now, everyone couldn't be more excited for us, our parents’ friends, everyone. They’re like, ‘It’s such an amazing way to do it’.</p><p id=e2FVAfBxxNUa data-wc=37><strong>Emily:&nbsp;</strong>They say, ‘You get to have maternity leave together and have this time to bond with the children together.’ Not once have they turned around now and said, ‘Who’s going to pick up the dog poo?’</p><p id=eDmPZTfs7iBH data-wc=38><strong>Kelly:&nbsp;</strong>They’re ready to help because they know that the eight weeks in between Emily giving birth and me being heavily pregnant is probably going to be a bit tricky, but they’re all up for it and ready.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d1f9a2abdf79-kerry-emily-baby-story.jpg><h2><strong>How are you feeling about the births?</strong></h2><p id=e-87dP6d0FZK data-wc=17><strong>Kerry:</strong> I did a hypnobirthing class the other day but it’s probably best not to overthink it.</p><p id=eNS_Fezumq9j data-wc=32><strong>Emily:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, I’m trying not to think about it too much – it freaks me out. People will ask if I want to hear a positive birth story and I’m like, ‘No!’</p><p id=eTjUXUI95n0s data-wc=15><strong>Kerry:&nbsp;</strong>But I like hearing people’s stories and how they set up their birth room.</p><p id=e9SoSC-Dn8kA data-wc=27><strong>Emily:</strong> I’m all about having one and then being done. I only have to give birth once and then we’ve got two children so that’s a bonus.</p><p id=eyl8dOIjUJO6 data-wc=28><strong>Kerry:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, I think unless we win the lottery and Emily gets a surrogate. We always said two children would be nice, and they’ll be the same age.</p><p id=eFxnf31vl7wb data-wc=18><strong>Emily:</strong> People have said that if I go into labour, it could trigger Kerry to give birth prematurely.</p><p id=eK5eZsuz56TH data-wc=55><strong>Kerry:</strong> We could, if we want to, breastfeed each other’s babies, but it could trigger me, so not before I’ve given birth. I don’t know how my body is going to react to there being a baby outside of my body, while my body is preparing for a baby inside. It’s going to be interesting.</p><h2><strong>How do you envisage the newborn days?</strong></h2><p id=evep0VSfRlot data-wc=32><strong>Kerry:</strong> We’ve been renovating our house for a few months now so we’re excited about having some downtime, and it will be winter, so we’ll put the fire on and watch Netflix.</p><p id=eFrMwUXW13Qt data-wc=41>The bonus for us is that most people have their partner there for a couple of weeks and then they get left on their own, whereas we’ll be home together. It will be nice to be able to go out together.</p><p id=ezw9IBoT9DpD data-wc=12><strong>Emily:</strong> We’ll see what happens.
