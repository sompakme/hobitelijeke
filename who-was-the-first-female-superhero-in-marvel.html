She's a master of magic and can alter reality itself, which is how she depowered most of the mutant race throughout the multiverse.</p><h2>Who is the girl Avenger with red hair?</h2>With her presence in The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch will not only be counted as one of the newest heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but she will also be presenting a whole new kind of power set.<h2>Who was the 1st Marvel superhero?</h2>Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman started the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939.

In the Mad Titan's possession, it would be incredibly difficult for Hela to defeat him either in a straight fight, or some other means.</p><h2>Who was the first non white superhero?</h2>Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Black Panther is often credited as the first Black superhero, having debuted in Marvel's Fantastic Four #52 in 1966, but in 1947 Black journalist Orrin C Evans created All-Negro Comics, the first ever all-Black comic book.<h2>Who was the first superhero of color?</h2>In the late 1960s, the first African-American superhero appeared in a mainstream comic: Samuel Wilson, aka "Falcon."
