And I'll take care of myself. And I'll see you in Sao Paulo. I love, love, love you.

There was a year where the partying just got a little too heavy. Thank God on some level this guy gave me the wrong line with the wrong thing one night and I woke up going, 'What the f**k happened?' That was a real changing point for me."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>After the August 2001 incident, the band had to pause work on their fourth studio album One by One while Hawkins recovered.</p><p>During the break, Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl accepted an offer from Queens of the Stone Age to play on their album Songs for the Deaf – which the drummer thought "looked like the end" of the band.</p><p>The band resumed work on One by One in October 2001.</p><p>"We tried to make One by One and it really looked like the end," he said.</p><p>"I don't think that glamorising that lifestyle is a good thing – I just don't. I think it's a bad message. I think people are gonna do what they're gonna do, kids are gonna f**k around, they're gonna experiment.</p><p>"If you have an addictive personality or you're a f**king dumb kid, you're gonna get drawn into it. You gotta be careful, man."</p><p>In another interview with British magazine Kerrang! last year, Hawkins shared harrowing details of the overdose.</p><p>"Everyone has their own path and I took it too far," he said.</p><p>"I was partying in London one night, and I mistakenly did something and it changed everything. I believed the bullsh*t myth of live hard and fast, die young. I'm not here to preach about not doing drugs, because I loved doing drugs, but I just got out of control for a while and it almost got me.</p><p>"I was heading down a road that was going to lead to even worse paths. Whether someone's sober, or they like a glass of wine with dinner, or they want a bottle of Jägermeister before they go on stage, or they like to smoke doobies all day long, everyone has their own path, and I took it too far.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"I'm glad it got knocked on the head at that point. I wouldn't take anything away that I've done or been through either, because it's all part of the trip and the journey. I'm trying to be as candid as I can be."</p><p>It's not clear when Hawkins began using drugs again.</p><p>Speaking to Ultimate Classic Rock in 2018, he said he had taken steps to get clean but did not want to get into details.</p><p>"I'm not an AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] dude," he said.</p><p>"I don't really discuss how I live my life in that regard. I have (a) system that works for me. There was a year [when] the partying just got a little too heavy. And thank God, on some level this guy gave me the wrong line or the wrong thing one night, and I woke up going, 'What the f**k happened?'</p><p>"That was a real changing point for me. There's no happy ending with hard drugs. You're gonna experiment, you're gonna do all that sh*t, but at the end of the day, there's no happy ending."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>In the 2021 Kerrang! interview, Hawkins revealed how mountain biking had helped him move forward.</p><p>"I get ideas for songs and it's where I do a lot of my problem solving and deep thinking," he said. "Sometimes I write songs in my head and then jump in my studio to put it down straight away. I like to go by myself. I like listening to old Aerosmith and Van Halen records to kind of pump me up. It's my time and I love it. It's a chance to clear your head out."</p><p>Speaking to Rolling Stone in 2017, Grohl described the three years from 1991 to 1994 as a "crash course in the danger of a band becoming popular so quickly".</p><p>"When the Foo Fighters started we made some pretty clear decisions about what to do and what not to do," he said.</p><p>Grohl told the publication the to-do list included "go out and play some shows, start from the ground up".</p><p>"And the not-to-do list?" Rolling Stone wrote. "Grohl laughs ruefully. 'I mean … heroin?'"</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Hawkins, then sober, also opened up about the overdose in the same interview.</p><p>"We went through a lot of crazy periods with our band early on," he said, adding that since then it had been smooth sailing.</p><p>"I'm not saying that I can't piss Dave off, or Dave can't bum me out – Dave can hurt my feelings more than anyone else in the world. But there's not an evil, out-to-get-you vibe. It's more sibling-like."</p><p>Hawkins was found on dead Friday in a hotel room at the Four Seasons Casa Medina in Bogota, Colombia.</p><p>An ambulance had been called to the hotel after the 50-year-old complained of "chest pain", but he was unable to be revived.</p><p>"The city's Emergency Regulation Centre received an alert about a patient with chest pain in a hotel located in the north of the city," the Secretariat of Health said in a statement.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"The District Secretariat of Health regrets the death of this talented and world-famous drummer and sends a message of condolences to his family, bandmates and fans."</p><p>No official cause of death has been released, but prosecutors in Colombia released a statement on Saturday saying toxicological tests on urine from Hawkins' body preliminarily found 10 psychoactive substances and medicines, including marijuana, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines.</p><p>Reports emerged on Sunday that Hawkins died of cardiovascular collapse, and that his heart was double the weight of a typical adult male's at the time of his death.</p><p>According to the Colombian publication Semana, his heart weighed over 600g, leaving forensic experts "shocked". Most men have a heart that weighs between 280 and 340 grams.</p><p>Authorities believe that factor played a part in Hawkins' death, along with a cocktail of drugs found in his system which included heroin, according to a report in a major Colombian newspaper.</p><p>"The Foo Fighters family is devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of our beloved Taylor Hawkins," the band said in a statement on social media over the weekend.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live on with all of us forever.
