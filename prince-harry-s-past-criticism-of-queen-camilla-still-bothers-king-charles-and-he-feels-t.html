During that awful time period, it was Camilla who kept the ship afloat, often stepping in for her husband at events as he received treatment for cancer, before his eventual return to public life on April 30 after about three months away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AqgoaDjcAk2T7Jja6wzgJY-1920-80.jpg><p>Apparently, according to Us Weekly, Camilla is also “imploring” her husband “to keep his distance” from his younger son, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-harry/>Prince Harry</a>, “and it's putting the King in a difficult position,” the publication writes. “Camilla dislikes Harry and doesn’t want Charles to get stressed while he’s undergoing treatment, so she tries to limit interaction,” a source speaking to the outlet said in what sounds like the stereotypical stepparent-stepchild worst nightmare.&nbsp;</p><p>The King, meanwhile, “is holding out hope of salvaging their relationship, but is hugely conflicted because Harry has hurt William and Camilla so much," they said. But, they added, it’s not a one-sided situation, as “Harry has also been hurt.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/akW9idWxmtaEwKaM9nrCrm-1920-80.jpg><p>Though conflict was certainly brewing before the 2023 publication of Harry’s memoir, Spare, it bubbled over after the bestselling book’s publication—specifically when it came to Camilla and Harry. In the book, Harry accused his stepmother’s team of leaking stories about him to the British press and labeled her “a villain.” He also leveled criticism at her in his six-part Netflix docuseries alongside wife Meghan Markle, appropriately called Harry & Meghan. “When the docuseries came out, Camilla was furious,” another source told Us Weekly. “Then, when Spare [was released], Camilla was saddened about what was said about her. She was heartbroken and confused.”</p><p>Royal biographer Christopher Andersen said that William and Harry “have always resented Camilla,” he said. “They pleaded with their father not to marry her and only grudgingly agreed to go along with the charade if Charles kept his promise not to make her Queen. That title would have gone to [their mother, Princess] Diana if Camilla hadn’t broken up their parents’ marriage. When Charles broke that promise, William and Harry felt betrayed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dUUQPLSpzMVCswKjyy2rLk-1920-80.jpg><p>While promoting Spare in a January 2023 interview with Good Morning America, Harry admittedly said it had been “a long time” since he’d spoken to Camilla, but said of her that “She’s my stepmother. I don’t look at her as an evil stepmother. I see someone who married into this institution and has done everything that she can to improve her own reputation and her own image, for her own sake.”</p><p>Flash forward to present day—specifically Harry’s visit to the U.K. last month for the 10-year anniversary celebrations of Harry’s <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/invictus-games/>Invictus Games</a>, which not only did the entire royal family skip, but the King seemed unable to make time in his schedule to see his younger son, who, of course, now lives in the U.S. and visits the U.K. sparingly. Andersen said he “sees the fine hand of Camilla” behind the King freezing Harry out: “She’s focused on her husband’s health, and injecting Harry into the equation will only cause more turmoil,” Andersen said. He added that Charles avoiding Harry “does seem a little callous—the late Queen Elizabeth said she wanted Harry to be considered part of the family, always.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

It’s not easy for him to forgive people who have scorned her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gPtB4dijwehEhtQFR88SJe-1920-80.jpg><p>Though William’s relationship with his stepmother was once rocky, too, fences seem to have mended on this front. “At one point, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-william/>Prince William</a>’s relationship with his stepmother was so bad that he allegedly ‘begged’ his father not to marry her,” <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13547219/Prince-William-Queen-Camilla-Royal-Ascot.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Daily Mail</u></a> reports. But this past week, Camilla and William “showed how far they have come in their relationship as they arrived at Royal Ascot together in what was a rare joint outing at a social occasion,” the outlet continues.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tgxLqn87YgBndgfALjF5HM-1920-80.jpg><p>While they also jointly attended the Commonwealth Day Service together back in March sans their respective spouses—as both were undergoing treatment for cancer—“that was an official engagement,” The Daily Mail reports. “Ascot is not on the roster of duties, and so will be seen by royal watchers as a sign of how well William and the Queen now get on.”</p><p>If reconciliation can happen once, surely it can happen twice, right? Again, we remain hopeful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiqn66urb%2BOpKCnn12YtaK%2By56qZqyfp7tursStrp6dnmK%2BtrHEp2ScmZ2eua2tjKmpoqaTmnqprdGrsGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-harry-s-past-criticism-of-queen-camilla-still-bothers-king-charles-and-he-feels-t.html&text=Prince%20Harrys%20Past%20Criticism%20of%20Queen%20Camilla%20Still%20Bothers%20King%20Charles%2c%20and%20He%20Feels%20T&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harry-s-past-criticism-of-queen-camilla-still-bothers-king-charles-and-he-feels-t.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-s-past-criticism-of-queen-camilla-still-bothers-king-charles-and-he-feels-t.html&title=Prince%20Harrys%20Past%20Criticism%20of%20Queen%20Camilla%20Still%20Bothers%20King%20Charles%2c%20and%20He%20Feels%20T" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-harry-s-past-criticism-of-queen-camilla-still-bothers-king-charles-and-he-feels-t.html&title=Prince%20Harrys%20Past%20Criticism%20of%20Queen%20Camilla%20Still%20Bothers%20King%20Charles%2c%20and%20He%20Feels%20T" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-s-past-criticism-of-queen-camilla-still-bothers-king-charles-and-he-feels-t.html&title=Prince%20Harrys%20Past%20Criticism%20of%20Queen%20Camilla%20Still%20Bothers%20King%20Charles%2c%20and%20He%20Feels%20T" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harry-s-past-criticism-of-queen-camilla-still-bothers-king-charles-and-he-feels-t.html&description=Prince%20Harrys%20Past%20Criticism%20of%20Queen%20Camilla%20Still%20Bothers%20King%20Charles%2c%20and%20He%20Feels%20T" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sean-lennon-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sean Lennon Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nigeria-s-dyed-cloth-traders-feel-heat-from-china-inflation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nigeria's dyed cloth traders feel heat from China, inflation">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
