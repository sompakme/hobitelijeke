And while their life in the U.S. has been filled with good news and accomplishments, like <a href=#>welcoming their daughter Lilibet</a> in 2021, launching the Archewell Foundation, or releasing their tell-all docuseries on Netflix, their milestones have also been shrouded with criticisms from the media and beyond.</p><p>So, of course, Markle and Harry needed <a href=#>a whole village of friends</a> to rely on throughout it all.</p><p>For Markle, there was a long list of friends she leaned on during her times of need. From her longtime friendship with former Suits alum Abigail Spencer to her blossoming friendship with fellow couple Katharine McPhee and David Foster, the Duchess of Sussex had plenty of friends in addition to Harry and her mom Doria Ragland to support her over the years.</p><p>To check out all the famous faces who make up Markle’s exclusive and A-list inner circle, scroll below!</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Brian Robbins & Tracy James</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/prince-harry-1.jpg><p>Markle and Harry’s friendship with the CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Brian Robbins and fashion designer Tracy James are the latest to blossom.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, they were spotted on a double date with the couple at Lucky’s, an upmarket steakhouse in Montecito, a day before the Sussex’s sixth wedding anniversary.

She’s an incredible person.”</p><p>In 2021, she also penned a touching tribute to the Duchess on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a>. “I’ve learned so much from Meg,” she wrote in the caption. “The power of a handwritten note. The loveliness of surprise flowers. That she has a perpetual rolodex in her brain of recommendations for the heart, soul, & body. When I’m headed to a new town, there’s a hotel or dinner reservation at the ready, as well as a connection with one of her friends to show me around so I feel less alone.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4526315789474><h2>Kelly Mckee Zajfen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150668409.jpg><p>Kelly Mckee Zajfen, the founder of Alliance of Mom, is another one of Markle’s best friends.&nbsp;</p><p>“When we speak about the people in our lives who lift us up when you need it with undeniable force of pure love I think of these two,” Zajfen wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> alongside pictures of herself, Markle and Spencer. “You inspire me.

At the time, their temporary place in Canada was already hounded by paparazzi.&nbsp;</p><p>“They hid out at my house for a long time,” Perry told Kelly Ripa in the Let’s Talk Off Camera podcast, per<a href=#> Vanity Fair</a>. “It was so great.”</p><p>“We needed a house and he offered security as well,” Markle said of the time in her interview with Oprah. “So it gave us breathing room to try to figure out what we are going to do.”</p><p>“They were so happy,” Perry said. “It was such a beautiful moment.”</p><p>Over a year later, Perry became the godfather to the Sussexes’ second child, Lilibet.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.7099373321397><h2>David Foster & Katharine McPhee</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1244259404.jpg><p>David Foster and Katharine McPhee is another duo both Markle and Harry hold dear.&nbsp;</p><p>And while the foursome might be new, McPhee and Markle’s friendship goes all the way back to high school. “Meghan and I did musicals together as kids,” McPhee captioned a throwback photo of herself and Meghan in costumes on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “She grew up to be the Duchess of Sussex and I grew up to star on the West End, so same life if you ask me. #TBT.”</p><p>Over the years, McPhee and Foster have reached out for support and even helped when Markle and Harry were <a href=#>looking for a home</a> after leaving the royal family.&nbsp;</p><p>“Katherine has become a trusted friend to Meghan,” a source told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>. “They weren’t exceptionally close as teenagers. Meghan was older. At a very vulnerable time leaving essentially the royal family, Katherine and David stepped in and were able to give them security and arranged for a lovely home for them to temporarily live in.”</p><p>Since then, they’ve been spotted on a few double dates around town.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4781659388646><h2>Janina Gavankar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1469351143.jpg><p>Janina Gavankar has not only been a longtime friend of Markle’s, but she spoke out when Markle and Harry were criticized following their Oprah Winfrey interview.&nbsp;</p><p>“Though their ‘recollections may vary,’ ours don’t because we lived through it with them,” Gavankar told The Morning at the time, per <a href=#>Elle</a>. “And there are many emails and texts to support that.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.7528517110266><h2>Misha Nonoo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1506552531.jpg><p>Markle and fashion designer Misha Nonoo’s friendship dates back to 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>“We met at a lunch in Miami during Art Basel,” Nonoo told <a href=#>The New York Times</a>. “And we sat down and we started, actually, right from the get-go, talking about a shared passion for equality, women’s empowerment and our love of dogs.”</p><p>In addition to attending Markle and Harry’s royal weddings, the Sussexes sat front row at Nonoo’s wedding in 2019, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hello!&nbsp;</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.9415347137637><h2>Serena Williams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1460949981.jpg><p>Serena Williams and Markle are also longtime friends, first meeting in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, the two have not only supported each other but have publicly defended each other too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Meghan is a great person and I think the epitome of strength, the epitome of confidence, the epitome of just selflessness, and the epitome of everything is just her and everything that she’s gone through,” the tennis pro said in 2021 after the Oprah interview, per <a href=#>People</a>. “And I know it’s not easy, and you can see from the interview that it wasn’t easy.
