The quality is indisputable and every purchase is one intended to live a long, happy life in your wardrobe.</p><p>While I could wax poetic about iconic Chanel accessories, I'm here to focus on the classic slingback two-tone pumps.

Yet, I will stand by the fact that the combinations of what you can pair them with are practically limitless.</p><p>In this five-outfit lineup I'm putting forth your way, they already break down to $175 per wear. I'm no mathematician (hence, why I ended up as a fashion editor), but it's safe to say some of you may have shoes only worn once for $175 sitting in your closet. Just sayin'. Of course, maintenance is a super important factor if you want to take the plunge here. Definitely consult your local cobbler, but proper upkeep that I would recommend is rubberizing the soles if you walk a lot and weekly polishing the leather toe and heel to buff out scuffing. I don't mean to be a nag, but taking care of your shoes will drastically extend their lifetime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJjufPNyjiw72mtK98AJrS-1920-80.jpg><p>Aside from being a very classic style, this version in the navy tweed fabrication is extremely versatile. For anyone who has the irrational phobia of pairing navy and black, it's time to get over it. It's an insanely chic combination.</p><p>The comfortable mid-heel height is ideal for daily wear. Even working from home, I felt put together and focused but also not insane for wearing these around the house. Getting dressed these days is still a challenge, especially with pumps, but I kept comfort top of mind and with a few little twists and tricks, put together easy looks for these shoes that anyone can master.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
