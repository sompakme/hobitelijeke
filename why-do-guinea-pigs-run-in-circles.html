If they come up and greet you or get excited and run around, it means they have the energy to do so.<h2>How long should guinea pigs be out of their cage?</h2>Guinea pigs need time outside of the cage each day for at least an hour, though twice a day is best. If possible, take them out at dawn and dusk, when cavies are most active. Either purchase a small pen or enclosure, or utilize a room where young children and other pets cannot gain access.<h2>What noise does a guinea pig make when happy?</h2>Whistling: Guinea pigs will often let out a high pitched squeal or whistle, and this noise means your furry friend is excited, perhaps about feeding time or playtime. Purring: Another guinea pig sound is the purr, which may make your guinea pig seem more like a cat. These purrs can have different meanings.<h2>Why does my guinea pig vibrate when I pet her?</h2>Good vibrations<p>When petting your guinea pig, you may notice it start to vibrate. Much like when cats purr, these vibrations show that they are at ease and are in a good mood. This response is more commonly seen in younger guinea pigs, a characteristic that they grow out of as they get older.</p><h2>What does a sad guinea pig sound like?</h2>Teeth chattering, hissing, growling, and whining are all some unhappy guinea pig sounds that your guinea pig may make when they are in discomfort with another piggie.<h2>How do guinea pigs say hello?</h2>A nose bump is a friendly hello, between piggies or a guinea pig and a human. This is the piggy version of the air kiss or the handshake.<h2>Why is my guinea pig squeaking when I pet him?</h2>Squeal: Some guinea pigs will squeal when they are experiencing potential pain or they need attention. It can sometimes be that another guinea pig is stealing his favorite spot to eat. Pay attention to your guinea pig if you hear a squeal because it could indicate that they need help from something hurting them.<h2>What are guinea pigs afraid of?</h2>What is this? Guinea pigs are scared of larger animals, people, sharp and loud noise, and even being alone. You'll have to try your best to take care of any of these things so that you can create a more friendly and comfortable environment for your guinea pigs.<h2>Do guinea pigs enjoy music?</h2>Do Guinea Pigs like music? Yes, Guinea pigs have been found to enjoy certain types of music played at a soft volume. There have been many studies on the topic of what music is best for guinea pigs to listen to. Most people agree that classical music or soft jazz, in particular, might be good choices.<h2>Do guinea pigs recognize their owners?</h2>True. Guinea pigs generally enjoy the company of their fellow cavies. Although it is not a good idea to house too many of them in one cage, most guinea pigs appreciate having a companion. They definitely recognize and respond to their owners and are very interactive.<h2>Why does my guinea pig popcorn when I pet him?</h2>It's a perfectly normal behavior. As long as the guinea pig seems to be in control and the jumps don't continue nonstop, enjoy the happy display. Although joy is the usual reason for popcorning, fear is sometimes the cause.<h2>How much interaction do guinea pigs need?</h2>Guinea pigs need time out of their cage every day. Whether this time is spent stretching their legs and exploring new environments or cuddling in your lap, daily interaction and attention are essential for a guinea pig's well-being. Guinea pigs need to be groomed regularly.<h2>Why does my guinea pig run when I touch him?</h2>A lot of pigs don't like the feeling of being 'caught' by a big hand, even if they enjoy being patted. They are prey animals and are conditioned to run from something bearing down on them- it's instinct.<h2>Do guinea pigs cry?</h2>So, although we wouldn't consider guinea pigs to cry 'emotional tears', like all mammals their eyes do produce physical tears. This is to keep their eye moist and clean.<h2>Why does my guinea pig stare at me?</h2>Guinea pigs often stare at people because they want attention. Perhaps piggies need to be cuddled, pet, or you should bring them a toy. They behave this way if they're used to being around humans and have bonded with their owners.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahsGacn2K0trXNnphmqJmcwG6%2B1KdkoqZdmLazr8ueqg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-do-guinea-pigs-run-in-circles.html&text=Why%20do%20guinea%20pigs%20run%20in%20circles%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-do-guinea-pigs-run-in-circles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-do-guinea-pigs-run-in-circles.html&title=Why%20do%20guinea%20pigs%20run%20in%20circles%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-do-guinea-pigs-run-in-circles.html&title=Why%20do%20guinea%20pigs%20run%20in%20circles%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-do-guinea-pigs-run-in-circles.html&title=Why%20do%20guinea%20pigs%20run%20in%20circles%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-do-guinea-pigs-run-in-circles.html&description=Why%20do%20guinea%20pigs%20run%20in%20circles%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=next><a href=./tim-mcgraw-and-faith-hill-s-relationship-timeline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's relationship timeline">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
