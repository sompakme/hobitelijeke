Now he is barely recognisable after he completely turned his life around.</p><p>It has been 11 years since Rouen won the third season of <span id=U66226374901HUF>The Biggest Loser</span>, and if you ask him what motivates him to keep going today, he will tell you – “I was given such a good opportunity and I don’t want to be back anywhere near where I used to be.”</p><p>The then 19-year-old shed 71kg during the series, but he now refuses to step on the scales.</p><p>“Biggest Loser was great for me but there was such a focus on numbers, so it was hard to switch that off,” Sam told news.com.au</p><p>“It’s probably been almost two years since I weighed myself. Straight after the show it became quite unhealthy.”</p><p>Rouen said he would weigh himself multiple times a day and obsess over everything he ate.</p><p>“It took me a couple of years for my metabolism to catch up, and for the past few years I’ve turned away from the scales and can’t even remember the last time I weighed myself. I base it off how I feel.”</p><p>He said it took him a few years to realise the numbers on the scale did not matter.</p><p><b>‘I’M A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON’</b></p><p>The Sydney local decided to enter the show as a last resort. He was adamant he wanted a healthy change and went on to prove what you can achieve with sheer determination and commitment.</p><p>“I’d always wanted to do something about my health. It was always diet and no exercise or exercise and no diet. Things just weren’t working and I knew that I needed to make a drastic change and called for extreme measures,” he said.</p><p>Now the gym junkie describes himself as a “completely different person” to the once overweight 19-year-old.</p><p>“When I was at my heaviest, I guess there wasn’t really any consideration as to what I would eat,” he said. “It was due to convenience or what I felt like. Now, my meals are much more structured and I am very conscious of what I’m consuming,” he said.</p><p>These days, you will find him at the gym between five and six times a week for about 90 minutes each day.</p><p>“I’ve changed my training to focus a lot more on strength training, so each session is focused around weight training, but I still incorporate cardio at the end of every session,” Rouen said.</p><p>“I guess the thing that keeps me focused is that I appreciate and enjoy my new lease on life.”</p><p>Rouen, who now rocks an impressive six-pack, has gone on to become a firefighter, even appearing twice in the annual firefighters calendar.</p><p>“When I started to cut down for the firefighter calendar and started to see abs for the first time, I had to pinch myself. I never in my life thought it would be possible or achievable for me,” he said.</p><p>When asked if he would chose to flaunt his impressive rig in another calendar, he laughed and said: “There’s definitely potential if they’ll have me.</p><p>“It’s such a great organisation to be involved with and the guys are such legends.”</p><p>Rouen said keeping a balanced lifestyle had been tough.</p><p>“It involves a lot of preparation, making sure I have meals prepared and gym gear on me so I can use any opportunity,” he explained.</p><p>“Working a lot of crazy hours currently means I need to be extra vigilant in organising the other aspects of my life.”</p><p>Rouen has been deployed to the fire-affected areas wreaking havoc across New South Wales.</p><p>“I’m sure if you ask any firefighter or someone in a fire-affected area, they would all say how demanding and devastating they have been,” he told news.com.au.</p><p>“I am based out towards St Mary’s but have been on strike teams all over, including Ulladulla, South Turramurra and Mangrove Mountain.”</p><p>While he said work can be challenging, he tries to remain as focused as possible.</p><p>“I do have to say, looking back at where I was when I first signed up for <span id=U66226374901FED>The Biggest Loser</span>, I’m extremely proud of all the changes that I’ve made and the direction it’s taken me on in life,” he said.</p><p>In fact, the gym junkie has never felt stronger.</p><p>“Having changed the focus of my training, it’s given me a new inspiration and enjoyment in the gym,” he said.</p><p>When it comes to his diet, Rouen starts his day with a black coffee and fasts through to lunch time.</p><p>“Lunch and dinner are very similar, usually just lean meats like chicken or pork with a large side of steamed vegies,” he said.</p><p><b>‘THE LITTLE CHANGES ADD UP’</b></p><p>For those wanting to also change their life for the better, Sam advises not to put it on hold.</p><p>“Start as soon as possible. Those small, little changes all add up,” he said. “Make easy healthier alternatives and then just stay consistent. People get so focused on needing results immediately, remember it takes time.”</p><p>Rouen recently admitted he still faced demons and challenges, but the day he won the reality TV show was the day he realised his self-worth.</p><p>“I hope that everyone has that opportunity to reflect on themself and realise how amazing they are, what they can achieve and what they are worth,” he said.</p><p>“I’m not sure what it will be for 2020 yet, but watch this space.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8Wiq6edo6h8qrrSqaCrmaSevK97waKeoJ2jqXqtu9KeqWarpJa%2Fbr%2FApmSrp6Wau260wKxkp52mmr9ussSlq2arpKe8r7PEq2annaeoerTAzquwaHCRZ7JxhJCabp1raWWzenzFaZpxamRnsXWAxWmdbG9j</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsam-rouen-reveals-his-unhealthy-obsession-after-winning-biggest-loser.html&text=Sam%20Rouen%20reveals%20his%20unhealthy%20obsession%20after%20winning%20Biggest%20Loser&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsam-rouen-reveals-his-unhealthy-obsession-after-winning-biggest-loser.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsam-rouen-reveals-his-unhealthy-obsession-after-winning-biggest-loser.html&title=Sam%20Rouen%20reveals%20his%20unhealthy%20obsession%20after%20winning%20Biggest%20Loser" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsam-rouen-reveals-his-unhealthy-obsession-after-winning-biggest-loser.html&title=Sam%20Rouen%20reveals%20his%20unhealthy%20obsession%20after%20winning%20Biggest%20Loser" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsam-rouen-reveals-his-unhealthy-obsession-after-winning-biggest-loser.html&title=Sam%20Rouen%20reveals%20his%20unhealthy%20obsession%20after%20winning%20Biggest%20Loser" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsam-rouen-reveals-his-unhealthy-obsession-after-winning-biggest-loser.html&description=Sam%20Rouen%20reveals%20his%20unhealthy%20obsession%20after%20winning%20Biggest%20Loser" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sofia-vergara-is-red-hot-in-the-most-figure-hugging-midi-dress.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sofia Vergara is red hot in the most figure-hugging midi dress">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./richard-gere-74-is-joined-by-rarely-seen-24-year-old-son-for-cannes-premiere.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Richard Gere, 74, is joined by rarely seen 24-year-old son for Cannes premiere">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
