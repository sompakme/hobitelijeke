While most horror films play around with the idea of fantasy, John Kramer – better known as the Jigsaw Killer – and his murderous methods are terrifyingly human, as if we could confront them in the real world if we wandered down the wrong path.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Seven years after Saw 3D – the seventh film in the series that was meant to act as its closing chapter – John Kramer is back to wreak havoc on the psyches of some more unsuspecting victims. But whether or not Jigsaw, which opens Halloween weekend, will have quite the same impact on the horror genre as its gory predecessors remains to be seen.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Until then, check out our pick of the&nbsp;10 most hideous Saw traps that have graced the silver screen over the past 13 years, sending audiences running for the door in disgust.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">1. The Reverse Bear Trap (Saw)</h4><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Perhaps one of the most prolific Saw traps of all time, this hideous invention has been&nbsp;done a number of times throughout the series. First appearing in the franchise’s debut, its first subject was Amanda, a heroin addict who found herself trapped in a head brace that was attached to her upper and lower jaw.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">It would snap open, tearing her face in two, if she couldn’t fetch the key from the stomach of her paralyzed cellmate. Amanda became the first subject to ever escape from Jigsaw’s clutches, but if you’re twisted enough to want to see what the Reverse Bear Trap looks like in action, check out Saw 3D. Spoiler: it’s gross.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">2. The Flammable Jelly Trap (Saw)</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">In this dastardly exercise from the debut Saw film, a man who defrauds a health insurance company wakes up, practically naked, in a dimly-lit room surrounded by broken glass and lathered in flammable, sticky jelly. He’s told by Jigsaw that there’s a deadly poison coursing through his veins that could kill him at any minute.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">There is an antidote, but it’s locked inside a heavy safe. The combination? Scrawled somewhere on the walls. With only a candle to guide him that could set him alight at any minute, and a carpet of glass between him and the brick walls of the room, he’d have to have been quick-thinking and resilient to win this agonizing race against time.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">3. The Pit of Needles (Saw II)</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Like a trypanophobe’s worst nightmare, the Pit of Needles trap appeared in the series’ sophomore feature – a film based around a group of people stuck in a booby-trapped, abandoned house by Jigsaw, with nerve gas slowly leaking through it.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Eventually, the surviving members of the group are offered the antidote to the nerve gas, but it’s behind a locked door, and the key is somewhere in a vat of dirty, contaminated needles that somebody must sift through. That person, once again, is "Reverse Bear Trap" Amanda. A little advice: if you faint at the sight of sharp objects, stay the hell away from this one.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">4. The ‘Venus Fly Trap’ Death Mask (Saw II)</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Picture this: you wake up, disoriented, with a massive metal trap around your neck and a swollen, bloody eye. You’re told you have 60 seconds to free yourself from the trap, but can only do so with the key that’s conveniently been burrowed behind your eye socket.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">One of the most brutal and yet simple Saw traps, this has gone down in history as truly heinous even by the Saw series’ standards, due to the fact that the prospect of escaping it seems pretty impossible. That’s proven by Michael Marks, a detective trying to solve the Jigsaw case, when he attempts unsuccessfully to free himself from it.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">5. The Vat of Pig Guts (Saw III)</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">There’s nothing overly violent about this trap, but it certainly doesn’t sound like a great way to go. So far, it’s appeared only once in Saw III, when recurring character Jeff Denlon, in an attempt to escape from a meatpacking plant Jigsaw has trapped him in, stumbles upon a room with a giant vat inside. Another character, Judge Halden, is strapped to the bottom of it with a metal plate around his neck, and a blender-like machine is looming overhead with rotten pigs’ carcasses waiting to drop through.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">There’s a key inside a burning hot incinerator that Jeff must try to fetch to free Halden, before he drowns in the stinking dead pig soup that’s poured on to him.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Watch it and admit: Saw traps rarely get as stomach churning as this.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">6. The Freezer Room (Saw III)</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">If you hate the cold, then this Saw trap might be your worst nightmare. A memorable moment from Saw III, it was used to punish Danica Scott, the only witness of a drunk driver’s hit and run that killed the kid of Jeff Denlon, the other man trapped in the room.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">In the film, Danica was stripped and hung by her arms from the ceiling of an industrial freezer, with six nozzles spraying water on to her, suffocating her slowly from the cold. The only way she could be freed was if Jeff could squeeze between the cooling pipes and find the key to the shackles that chained her up.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">7. The Angel Wings Trap (Saw III)</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">This heinous contraption from the Jigsaw Killer’s apprentices is one of the most nerve-shredding and ugly traps the series has featured. First appearing in Saw III, it was used to execute Alison Kerry, a detective getting deeper and deeper into the Jigsaw case.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">The trap sees the subject suspended in the air, their arms attached to chains hanging from the ceiling with a leather harness wrapped around their ribcage, ready to rip it open at any moment, like a bird spreading its blooded wings. The key to the trap is in a jar of acid, also suspended from the ceiling, so the subject has to go through that ordeal too before being able to free themselves. Can’t get out in time? It gets messy.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">8. The Knife Chair (Saw IV)</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Is there anything sorer than accidentally cutting yourself a little too deep when chopping food in the kitchen? Well imagine that sensation, slowly - and all over your body. In Saw IV, the Knife Chair trap sees Cecil Adams – a recovering drug addict – be punished for his petty crimes by being strapped into a wooden chair that has blades pointing upwards into his wrists, causing him to bleed out.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">To free himself, he would have to push his head forward to reach a plate that would release the shackles – but there’s a twist. In the way are eight knifes, blades forward, that will shred his face apart if he pushes too hard.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">9. The Scalping Machine (Saw IV)</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">One of the first tests in Saw IV, the Scalping Machine is a Saw trap that the Jigsaw Killer invented to spite Brenda, a pimp who’d abuse the plight of sex workers for her own power. A chair attached to a mechanical axis that cranks backwards, pulling the subject’s hair with it, it’s designed to slowly and agonizingly scalp them.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Two people are needed to to solve it, thanks to the fact that the combination to be freed lies out of sight to the person who’s strapped in. Find yourself stuck in it all alone? You’re toast.</p><h4 class="headline___LiMCD headline-heading30___n2RNL contentHeadline___rzttt headline___zfG1Z">10. The '10 Pints of Sacrifice' ('Saw V')</h4><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this YouTube video.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">There are&nbsp;10 pints of blood in the body, so what happens when you have&nbsp;to give up some of it, in a violent manner, to survive? That’s the idea behind this Saw trap, which sees two characters, Malick and Brit, confront a deadly contraption towards the end of Saw V.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Also known as the blade table, it asks participants to enter their arms into a trap that contains a rotating saw blade. Once inside, blood trickles down into a beaker that, once full, will open the door to let the victims escape.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">We can survive with half of the blood in our body, so if two people put themselves forward you can both walk away injured, but alive. Or, you could just sacrifice one unlucky soul.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Here are five reasons you should be <a href=#>excited to watch Black Panther</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXGoaqnp5KesrXFjZympmegZMSwvtKtZKyZp2LBs63PrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-most-gruesome-traps-that-will-turn-your-stomach.html&text=10%20Most%20Gruesome%20Traps%20That%20Will%20Turn%20Your%20Stomach&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-most-gruesome-traps-that-will-turn-your-stomach.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-most-gruesome-traps-that-will-turn-your-stomach.html&title=10%20Most%20Gruesome%20Traps%20That%20Will%20Turn%20Your%20Stomach" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-most-gruesome-traps-that-will-turn-your-stomach.html&title=10%20Most%20Gruesome%20Traps%20That%20Will%20Turn%20Your%20Stomach" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-most-gruesome-traps-that-will-turn-your-stomach.html&title=10%20Most%20Gruesome%20Traps%20That%20Will%20Turn%20Your%20Stomach" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-most-gruesome-traps-that-will-turn-your-stomach.html&description=10%20Most%20Gruesome%20Traps%20That%20Will%20Turn%20Your%20Stomach" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./david-beckham-s-unusual-day-out-with-daughter-harper-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Beckham's unusual day out with daughter Harper revealed">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./will-kuhli-loaches-breed-in-tank.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will kuhli loaches breed in tank?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
